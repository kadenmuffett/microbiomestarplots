Description: This package is designed to take a dataframe or phyloseq object and generate compositional starplots for microbiome data. This encompassed four key functions: a way to simultaneously compare PCoA positions of groups at up to 5 levels, a way to identify core microbiome overlap among groups, a visualization tool for comparative core microbiota, and a starplot for any taxa.

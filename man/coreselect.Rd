\title{Select and Plot Core Microbiome}
\usage{
coreselect(physeq, group_var, percent_samples = 0.95, abundance_threshold = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{A phyloseq object containing your microbiome data.}

\item{group_var}{A character string. The name of the column in your sample data
to use for grouping samples (e.g., "Treatment", "Location").}

\item{percent_samples}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 (or 0 and 100).
The percentage of samples within a group that a taxon must be present in to be considered "core".
If > 1, it is treated as a percentage (e.g., 50 means 50\%). If <= 1, it is treated as a proportion (e.g., 0.5 means 50\%).}

\item{abundance_threshold}{A numeric value (default 0).
The relative abundance (or count, depending on your data) threshold a taxon must exceed
in a sample to be considered "present".}

\item{fill_alpha}{A numeric value for the point transparency (not used in current plot design but kept for consistency, reserved).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the core taxa presence/absence plot.
}
\description{
This function identifies "core" taxa within treatment groups—defined as taxa present
in a specified percentage of samples at a specified relative abundance—and visualizes
their presence/absence across all groups.
}
\examples{
# data(GlobalPatterns)
# coreselect(GlobalPatterns, "SampleType", percent_samples = 50, abundance_threshold = 0)
